**A collection of some of my ML projects in Python**
1. One-R and Naive Bayes Classifiers from scratch (Pima-Indian Diabetes Dataset)
2. Neural Network Classifier from scratch (Only Uses numpy, no tensorflow/pytorch/scikit-learn)
3. ADDNET (Reproducing experiments from the ADDNET paper for Alzheimer's detection)
4. Baby Names (Uses recurrent neural networks to generate baby names from babynames.txt)
 
**More to come later...**
